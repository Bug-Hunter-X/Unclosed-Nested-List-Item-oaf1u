# Unclosed Nested List Item
This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: an unclosed nested list item.  The error is subtle but can lead to unexpected rendering issues in the browser.

## Bug
The `bug.html` file contains an unclosed nested list item. This means that the browser does not correctly understand the structure of the list, potentially leading to incorrect display of the list items.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.html` file shows the correct version with properly closed nested list items. This results in a correct and consistent list rendering.

## How to run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` and `bugSolution.html` in a web browser to observe the difference in rendering caused by the unclosed nested list item.
